In this work, we describe the task of exoplanet detection and the methods applied to this task, both classical and recent. The transit method emerges as the most popular approach in the machine learning literature and is the most common method leading to confirmed exoplanet discoveries. Well-known studies leverage both traditional and deep-learning machine-learning methods for detection, with convolutional neural networks being the most prevalent.

Our work employs a transformer network on a pre-processed dataset comprising time-series star flux values from the Kepler Space Telescope experiment. While our model correctly classifies most negative cases, it struggles to classify any of the few positive cases. There is potential for future work to enhance our model. For instance, pre-training the transformer with self-supervised learning on the vast volume of Kepler data before supervised training could assist the model in learning the essential features necessary for accurate classifications.
